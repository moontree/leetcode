Project -> File: leetcode -> 1379_Find_a_Corresponding_Node_of_a_Binary_Tree_in_a_Clone_of_That_Tree.py
Author: zhangchao
=========================
Given two binary trees original and cloned and given a reference to a node target in the original tree.

The cloned tree is a copy of the original tree.

Return a reference to the same node in the cloned tree.

Note that you are not allowed to change any of the two trees or t
he target node and the answer must be a reference to a node in the cloned tree.

Follow up: Solve the problem if repeated values on the tree are allowed.

Example 1:
Input:
    tree = [7,4,3,null,null,6,19], target = 3
Output:
    3
Explanation:
    In all examples the original and cloned trees are shown.
    The target node is a green node from the original tree.
    The answer is the yellow node from the cloned tree.

Example 2:
Input:
    tree = [7], target =  7
Output:
    7

Example 3:
Input:
    tree = [8,null,6,null,5,null,4,null,3,null,2,null,1], target = 4
Output:
    4

Example 4:
Input:
    tree = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], target = 5
Output:
    5

Example 5:
Input:
    tree = [1,2,null,3], target = 2
Output:
    2


Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
    The values of the nodes of the tree are unique.
    target node is a node from the original tree and is not null.
